\section{Job Scheduling / Makespan problem}
Given $m$ machines and $n$ jobs with workload $p_1, ..., p_n$, give a schedule that 
\[
  \min_{\text{$m$ machines}} \max \{ \text{workload for a single machine}\}
\]
This problem is NP hard. We can use a Greedy algorithm to achieve $4/3$ approximation. If the number of distinct workload is restricted to $k$ , there is a DP solution of $O(n^{2k})$ which gives the exact solution to the corresponding decision problem : Can the $m$ machines finish the job within $T$ times. (Suppose the workload is the time it takes to complete the job for one machine. )

Suppose there are $b_i$ jobs for workload $p_i$, and we have $(b_1, ..., b_k)$ jobs in total. Let $M(c_1, ..., c_k)$ denote the minimum number of machines needed to complete $(c_1, ..., c_k)$ jobs within time $T$. Then it's easy to check whether $M(c_1, ..., c_k) > 1$ and quitely clearly, $M(0, ..., 0) = 0$

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
for c_1 in range(1, b_1 + 1):
  for c_2 in range(1, b_2 + 1):
    ...
    for c_k in range(1, b_k + 1):
      if M(c_1, ..., c_k) > 1:
        S = {(j_1, ..., j_k)| j_i < c_i for all i, M(j_1, ..., j_k) = 1}
        M(c_1, ..., c_k) = 1 + min(M(c_1 - j_1, ..., c_k - j_k) over S)
if M(b_1, ..., b_k) > m:
  return False
else:
  return True

\section{(Minimum Weight) Perfect Matching/ Minimum Weight Cycle Cover}
A \textbf{perfect matching} is a matching which matches all vertices of the graph. That is, every vertex of the graph is incident to exactly one edge of the matching. \footnote{Matching (graph theory), wikipediea} The mini-weight perfect matching problem can be solved in polynomial time. 

A \textbf{minimum weight cycle cover} of a graph is stated as follows. Let $H = (V, E)$ be a directed graph with non-negative arc weights given by $w: E \rightarrow R ^+$. We wish to find a minimum weight collection of vertex-disjoint directed cycles in $H$ such that every vertex is in exactly one of those cycles. \footnote{HW0/6, Spring 2011, CS 598CSC, University of Illinois}. We need this to give an approximation algo to the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP).

\textbf{Algorithm}:
For each node $v \in V$, split it into $v^+$ and $v^-$, where $v^+$ is the `in-node' and $v^-$ is the `out-node'. Solve the minimum perfect matching problem on the new graph. Done.
